# ⚡ ClawFleet Marketing Toolkit

This toolkit is designed to convert performance-obsessed developers into paid users by emphasizing the **Sub-Millisecond** nature of the platform.

---

## 🎯 The "Performance-First" Angle

**The Narrative:** Current AI orchestrators are legacy systems built on HTTP polling. They are slow, laggy, and expensive. ClawFleet is a binary-first, WebSocket-powered command center that reacts at silicon speeds (0.2ms).

### Post 1: The "Aha!" Moment

> Stop polling your agents like it’s 2012.
>
> Most orchestrators: 2.5s latency (HTTP waterfalls) 🐌
> ClawFleet: 0.1ms heartbeat (Binary WebSockets) ⚡
>
> Real-time isn't fast enough. You need Sub-Millisecond.

## 💬 Hacker News / Reddit Pitch

**Title:** Show HN: ClawFleet – Sub-millisecond orchestration for AI agent swarms

**Pitch:**
Most AI orchestrators today are essentially CRUD apps with long-polling. We built ClawFleet to handle the scale of autonomous swarms where every millisecond of coordination counts.

- **Latency:** 0.1ms - 0.5ms heartbeat floor.
- **Security:** Zero-knowledge. AES-256-GCM encryption in the browser. We never see your secrets.
- **Scale:** Lightweight agents run as single binaries on edge compute.
- **Control:** Granular internal policies to stop rogue agents from burning your bank account.

## 📈 Growth Tactics

1.  **Metric-Driven Screenshots:** Share clips of the "0.2ms Latency" pulse on the dashboard. Devs love raw numbers.
2.  **Hacking Policy Enforcement:** Create a blog post: "How to stop an autonomous agent from spending $500 in 5 minutes with Policy Guardrails."
3.  **Comparison Articles:** "ClawFleet vs. LangSmith vs. Helicone". Pivot the conversation from "Analytics" (passive) to "Orchestration" (active).

## 🚀 Conversion Funnel

- **Free Tier:** Hook them with the speed and the "Brutalist" UI.
- **Pro Tier ($99/mo):** Sell the "Insurance" (Guardrails) and the "Scale" (Unlimited Nodes).
- **Enterprise:** Sell the "Compliance" (SSO, Air-gap).
