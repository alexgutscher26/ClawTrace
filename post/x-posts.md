## 🧵 Thread 1: The "Financial Danger" Hook (Based on the Blog Post)

**Tweet 1:**
Stop worrying about AGI. Start worrying about your credit card. 💸

I just watched an autonomous agent burn $500 in 5 minutes because it got stuck in a `while(true)` loop hallucinating a validation step.

High-performance AI needs high-performance guardrails.

Here is how we solved it at 0.2ms latency 👇

**Tweet 2:**
Most "guardrails" are just prompts.
"Please don't spend too much money." 🥺

LLMs ignore prompts when they hallucinate. You can't talk a race car out of crashing. You need brakes.

**Tweet 3:**
We built a "Cost Velocity" circuit breaker into the ClawFleet orchestrator.

Policy: "If Agent X > $1.00/min → KILL TCP CONNECTION."

It happens at the network layer. The agent doesn't get a vote.
Sub-millisecond enforcement.

Don't let a stochastic parrot bankrupt your startup.

## ⚡ Post 2: The Latency Flex (Direct & Aggressive)

Stop polling your agents like it’s 2012. 🐌

Most orchestrators: **2.5s latency** (HTTP waterfalls)
ClawFleet: **0.1ms heartbeat** (Binary WebSockets)

Real-time isn't fast enough. You need Sub-Millisecond.
