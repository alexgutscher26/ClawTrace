# 🚀 Product Hunt Launch Guide: ClawFleet

**Target Launch Date:** [Insert Date] (Best days: Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday)
**Time:** 12:01 AM PT (San Francisco Time) - _Crucial for ranking_

## 1. The Listing

### **Name**

**ClawFleet**

### **Tagline**

**The Sub-Millisecond Orchestrator for AI Agent Swarms**
_(Alternative: Stop Polling. Start Streaming. Real-time AI Fleet Control.)_

### **Description (The Hook)**

Most AI agents are slow (2.5s latency) and expensive (looping errors). ClawFleet is a binary-first, WebSocket-powered command center that runs at 0.1ms latency. It includes "Policy Guardrails" to instantly kill agents that burn too much money.

### **Topics**

- Developer Tools
- Artificial Intelligence
- SaaS
- Open Source

### **Gallery (Required Assets)**

1.  **Thumbnail (GIF):** A looping GIF of the "Live Heartbeat" pulse (0.2ms) + a terminal window scrolling fast.
2.  **Screenshot 1 (The Dashboard):** The full "Grid Brutalist" UI showing 50+ active agents.
3.  **Screenshot 2 (The Kill Switch):** A close-up of the "Policy Enforcement" blocking a $500 API call.
4.  **Screenshot 3 (The Terminal):** The `clawtrace-cli` running deeply nested commands.
5.  **Video:** A 30-second loom showing: "Here is a slow agent (polling). Here is ClawFleet (streaming). See the difference?"

## 2. The Maker Comment (Your "Why")

_Post this immediately after launching. It anchors the conversation._

**Subject:** Why I killed my own AI agents

Hey Hunters! 👋

I'm [Name], the creator of **ClawFleet**.

I built this because I lost $500 in one night. I had a swarm of autonomous agents running a research task, and one of them got stuck in a `while(true)` validation loop. By the time I woke up, my OpenAI bill was on fire.

I realized two things:

1.  **Polling is too slow.** Waiting 3 seconds to see if an agent is broken is 3 seconds too long.
2.  **Prompts aren't guardrails.** Asking an LLM nicely "please don't spend money" doesn't work when it hallucinates.

So I built **ClawFleet**. It's an orchestrator that uses **WebSockets** (not HTTP) to maintain a **0.1ms heartbeat** with every agent.

It lets you set **Cost Velocity Policies**.

> _“If this agent spends > $1.00/minute, cut the connection.”_

It happens at the network layer. The agent doesn't get a vote.

We are live in Open Beta.
The Free Tier handles up to 5 agents.
The Pro Tier is for serious swarm operators.

I'll be hanging out in the comments all day—would love to hear how you handle "rogue" agents! 🤖💸

## 4. The "Hunter"

Since this is a dev tool, you can "Hunt" it yourself. The myth that you _need_ a top hunter is dead.

- **Self-Hunting:** It shows confidence. "I built this, and I'm launching it."
- **The Community:** The r/LocalLLaMA and r/AutoGPT crowds are your real boosters. Drop the link in the Reddit threads (see `post/reddit-pitch.md`).

**Good luck.** 🚀
